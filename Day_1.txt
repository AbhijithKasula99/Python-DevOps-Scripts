#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# Figured out print function
print("Hello Kasula, Welcome back!")
# Hello Kasula, Welcome back! is a string of characters

# Printing multiple lines
print("Day 1 - Python Print Function")
print("The function is declared like this:")
print("print('what to print')")

# Printing multiple lines using one print function
print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!")

# String Concatenation
print("Abhijith" + "Kasula")
print("Abhijith " + "Kasula")
print("Abhijith" + " " + "Kasula")

# Input Function
# print("Hello " + input("What is your name?"))
# Ctrl + / for commenting
# Ctrl + Z for undo

# Count the number of characters in your name
# We did that using len() function in python
# print(len((input("What is your name? "))))

'''
Once the input is given,
the input function stores it and 
we can use it by assigning it to a variable 
'''
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(name)
length = len(name)
print(length)

name = "Kasula"
print(name)

name = "Abhijith"
print(name)
# We can get to know that the Python is a top-down dynamic language.

# Coding Exercise

a = input("a: ")
b = input("b: ")

c = a
a = b
b = c

print("a = " + a)
print("b = " + b)

# Name your variables in a way that it makes sense to you.
# Don't use space, use '_' to give space
# Don't start with numbers or use built-in functions
